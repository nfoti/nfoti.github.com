<p>I am a Washington Research Foundation Innovation Postdoctoral Fellow in
Neuroengineering and Data Science at the University of Washingtion, jointly
sponsored by the <a href="http://uwin.washington.edu">Institute for Neuroengineering</a>
and the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu">eScience Institute</a>. I work with
<a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/">Emily Fox</a> in the Department of
Statistics and <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/akclee/">Adrian KC Lee</a> in the
Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences.</p>

<p>My research focuses on developing statistical and machine learning methods to
learn structure underlying data that arise from processes that exhibit complex
dependencies such as neuroimaging data. In particular, I am interested in
Bayesian nonparametric methods as well as sparse models for high-dimensional
data. Additionally, I am interested in developing scalable inference algorithms
for complex models of large data sets.</p>

<p>I received my PhD from the Computer Science Department at Dartmouth College.
My advisor was <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~rockmore">Dan
Rockmore</a>. I worked closely with <a href="http://sinead.github.io/">Sinead
Williamson</a> on dependent Bayesian nonparametric
models and efficient MCMC algorithms for them.</p>
