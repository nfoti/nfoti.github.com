<p>I am a Principal Research Scientist at Apple working on various aspects of machine learning and applications thereof.</p>

<p>Prior to Apple I was at the University of Washington from 2013 – 2018 where I
was first a postdoc and then a research scientist. I worked with <a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/">Emily
Fox</a> and <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/akclee/">Adrian KC
Lee</a> on developing machine learning
models of MEG data to understand dynamic brain connectivity underlying auditory
attention. During my time at UW I also worked with a number of great students
on projects related to Bayesian nonparametrics, variational inference and MCMC
methods, time series analysis, optimization algorithms, and deep latent variable models.</p>

<p>I received my PhD from the Computer Science Department at Dartmouth College
where I was advised by <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~rockmore">Dan Rockmore</a>.
While in graduate schoool, I worked closely with <a href="http://sinead.github.io/">Sinead
Williamson</a> on dependent Bayesian nonparametric
models and efficient MCMC algorithms for them.</p>
