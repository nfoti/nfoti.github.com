I am a Principal Research Scientist at Apple working on various aspects of machine learning and applications thereof.

Prior to Apple I was at the University of Washington from 2013 -- 2018 where I
was first a postdoc and then a research scientist. I worked with [Emily
Fox](http://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/) and [Adrian KC
Lee](http://faculty.washington.edu/akclee/) on developing machine learning
models of MEG data to understand dynamic brain connectivity underlying auditory
attention. During my time at UW I also worked with a number of great students
on projects related to Bayesian nonparametrics, variational inference and MCMC
methods, time series analysis, optimization algorithms, and deep latent variable models.

I received my PhD from the Computer Science Department at Dartmouth College
where I was advised by [Dan Rockmore](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~rockmore).
While in graduate schoool, I worked closely with [Sinead
Williamson](http://sinead.github.io/) on dependent Bayesian nonparametric
models and efficient MCMC algorithms for them.
