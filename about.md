I am a Washington Research Foundation Innovation Postdoctoral Fellow in
Neuroengineering and Data Science at the University of Washingtion, jointly
sponsored by the [Institute for Neuroengineering](http://uwin.washington.edu)
and the [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu). I work with
[Emily Fox](http://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/) in the Department of
Statistics and [Adrian KC Lee](http://faculty.washington.edu/akclee/) in the
Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences.

My research focuses on developing statistical and machine learning methods to
learn structure underlying data that arise from processes that exhibit complex
dependencies such as neuroimaging data. In particular, I am interested in
Bayesian nonparametric methods as well as sparse models for high-dimensional
data. Additionally, I am interested in developing scalable inference algorithms
for complex models of large data sets.

I received my PhD in computer science at Dartmouth College. My advisor was [Dan
Rockmore](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~rockmore). I worked closely with [Sinead
Williamson](http://sinead.github.io/) on dependent Bayesian nonparametric
models and efficient MCMC algorithms for them.
